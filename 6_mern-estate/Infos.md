## Project Setup

- You can drag and drop a folder into Visual Studio Code, and it will open it as a project.
- Use the command: `npm create vite@latest client` to initiate a dialog for creating a project.
- From the options provided, select React and then JavaScript + SWC.
- This will result in the creation of a `client` folder filled with React content.
- Change your directory to `client` with the command: `cd client`.
- Install all the required dependencies using: `npm i`.

## Understanding Key Terms

- **Vite:** [Brief description or a link to learn more about Vite]
- **Client Folder:** This is the primary directory where the project resides.
- **Tailwind CSS:** [Brief description or a link to learn more about Tailwind CSS]

## Installing Tailwind CSS

- For installation with Vite, follow the guide on the [Tailwind CSS official documentation for Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).
- Navigate to the `client` folder and run the following command to install required packages: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.
- To initialize configuration files, use: `npx tailwindcss init -p`. This will create:
  - `postcss.config.js`
  - `tailwind.config.js`
- Note: `app.css` isn't necessary in this setup.

## VS Code Extensions

Several Visual Studio Code extensions can enhance this development setup:

1. **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets:** Offers code suggestions and more.
2. **Auto Rename Tag:** Automatically renames the ending HTML/XML tag when the opening tag is altered, and vice versa.
3. **Console Ninja:** Displays console outputs in the terminal instead of the browser.
4. **Prettier:** Auto-formats your code upon saving.
5. **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense:** Provides auto-suggestions and more for Tailwind CSS.

Additional commands:

- `clear`: This command clears the terminal/console.
- To run the application, use: `npm run dev`.

## Creating Pages and Routes

1. Create a `pages` folder and add the following files:
  - `src/pages/About.jsx`
  - `src/pages/Home.jsx`
  - `src/pages/Profile.jsx`
  - `src/pages/SignIn.jsx`
  - `src/pages/SignUp.jsx`

2. In the `client` folder, install the router using: `npm i react-router-dom`.

3. Implement routing by importing necessary components and defining routes. Here's a sample:

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import SignIn from "./pages/SignIn";
import SignUp from "./pages/SignUp";
import About from "./pages/About";
import Profile from "./pages/Profile";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home/>} />
        <Route path="/sign-in" element={<SignIn/>} />
        <Route path="/sign-up" element={<SignUp/>} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About/>} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile/>} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
## Auto Import of Elements

In Visual Studio Code, elements will be imported automatically if you have them opened as a tab. This feature streamlines the development process by reducing the need to manually write import statements. By simply having the relevant file open in a tab, VS Code can suggest or even auto-import elements or components from it.
