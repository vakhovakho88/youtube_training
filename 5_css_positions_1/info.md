- shift+1 and then tab generates html boilerplate



- position: static -> it is default for every htm element, it just says follow another elements in HTML flow. 
- position: relative -> It is just like static (default), but it allows us to edit top,left, bottom, rigth values. It just overflows another elements if our values are not precise.
- position: absolute -> the element will be absolutely ignored in the flow, it absolutely positions element inside an parent element (if we assigt values starting point  will be HTML). if we want that starting point of a div with absolute position is starting point of its parent div, we should make a parent div position relative or absolute.
- position: fixed, positioning starting point is HTML-Element, if we scroll it doesnot scroll.
- position: sticky, combination of relative and fixed. It is just relative when we load a website, but if we scroll it stays fixed. For example if we want a logo to stay every time on screen.
